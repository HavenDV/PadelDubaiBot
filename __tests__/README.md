- **Coverage**: HTML restoration, player registration, constants, performance, edge cases

### `core-functionality.test.ts`

- **Purpose**: Comprehensive tests for critical business logic
- **Status**: âœ… 15/15 tests passing (issues fixed!)
- **Coverage**: Deep testing of HTML formatting, registration system, error handling

### `constants.test.ts`

- **Purpose**: Tests for Telegram constants, templates, and helper functions
- **Status**: âœ… 14/14 tests passing
- **Coverage**: Skill level buttons, club locations, calendar links, message templates

### `integration-workflow.test.ts`

- **Purpose**: End-to-end integration tests for complete user workflows
- **Status**: âœ… 7/7 tests passing
- **Coverage**: HTML restoration workflow, player promotion, performance, edge cases

### `TESTING.md`

- **Purpose**: Comprehensive documentation of testing strategy
- **Coverage**: Testing philosophy, patterns, utilities, debugging guides

## Key Testing Insights

### What Works Well

âœ… HTML formatting restoration from Telegram webhooks
âœ… Basic player registration functionality  
âœ… Performance requirements (50+ operations < 100ms)
âœ… Error handling with malformed inputs
âœ… Special character support in usernames
âœ… Calendar and map link generation

### Issues Discovered (FIXED! âœ…)

âœ… Double HTML formatting in some scenarios - **FIXED**
âœ… Player cancellation logic not working as expected - **FIXED**
âœ… Waitlist display format using ðŸŽ¾ emoji - **FIXED**

## Testing Philosophy

### Simple, Reliable Approach

- Use relative imports (`../src/`) instead of complex module mapping
- Focus on critical business logic over implementation details
- Ensure tests work across different environments
- Prioritize readability and maintainability

### Coverage Strategy

- **Critical Features**: 100% test coverage (HTML restoration, registration)
- **Business Logic**: 90%+ coverage (player management, notifications)
- **Edge Cases**: Comprehensive error scenarios
- **Performance**: Efficiency requirements for production load

## Running Tests

```bash
# All tests
npm test

# Specific file
npm test __tests__/example-simple.test.ts

# Watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Identified Issues**: Address double formatting and cancellation logic
2. **Add API Tests**: Mock Telegram API calls for webhook testing
3. **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflow testing
4. **Performance Benchmarks**: Automated performance regression testing

## Test Development Guidelines

### Writing New Tests

1. Start with `example-simple.test.ts` patterns
2. Use descriptive test names explaining the scenario
3. Follow Arrange-Act-Assert structure
4. Mock external dependencies appropriately
5. Include performance assertions for critical paths

### Debugging Tests

1. Use `console.log` in tests (removed by coverage)
2. Run single test files for faster iteration
3. Check actual vs expected outputs carefully
4. Verify mock setup and timing

This test suite provides a solid foundation for maintaining and extending the Padel Dubai Bot with confidence.
